2014-07-30 Doug	
	* Add methods for the monojet analysis
	
2014-04-02 Steve
	* Added deprecation warnings to SusyNtTools methods: buildSumwMap and getEventWeight
		* Users should update to usage of the MCWeighter class,
		  as demonstrated in the Susy3LepCutflow class

2014-03-26 Steve
	* Moved JVF sys enums to SusyNtSys
		* Kinda goes against my thinking that this enum should
		  only be for variations that are saved in the ntuple,
		  but otherwise I'd have to add an additional sys enum
		  argument to the selectObjects methods, so this is
		  cleaner to the user
	* Added JVF systematic to SusyNtTools
		* JVFUncertaintyTool instantiated in SusyNtTools
		* Controlled via usual object syst enum, SusyNtSys,
		  when calling selectObjects method
		* I had to make some of the jet counting methods
		  (and getMetRel) non-static to accommodate the usage
		  of the JVFUncertaintyTool

2014-03-25 Steve
	* Added JVF sys enums to SusyDefs.h

2014-03-21 Steve
	* Added JVFUncertaintyTool to installMinimalSUSYTools script,
	  necessary for applying the JVF systematic

2014-03-08 Steve
	* Updated MCWeighter
		* Now accepts a TTree for building the sumw map,
		  and has dedicated methods for TTree and TChain
		* TTree arg to constructor no longer default
	* Updated usage of MCWeighter in Susy3LepCutflow
		* Now instantiated and initialized in Init method rather than main.
		  It cannot be initialized in Begin because the tree pointer isn't set.
		  	* This is just one way to initialize the MCWeighter.
			* NOTE: This is explicitly incompatible with PROOF. But then
			  again, I don't think the rest of our code is PROOF-compatible
			  anyway.
	* MCWeighter TODO
		* Update usage in Susy2LepCutflow
		* Change SusyNtAna and SusyNtTools methods to use 
		  MCWeighter behind the scenes.
	* Added second version of template dumpObjects method to SusyNtTools,
	  a version for vectors of objects as well as the original one for
	  vectors of object pointers.

2014-03-03 Steve
	* Code improvements for MCWeighter

2014-03-02 Steve
	* Added full functionality to MCWeighter class
		* getMCWeight, getSumw, getCrossSection, getXsecTimesEff, getPileupWeight
		* Also added methods and enums for controlling the sumw and xsec methods
		* Currently copies the functionality in SusyNtTools. I haven't removed
		  the old approach yet.
	* Made BTagCalib a static pointer in SusyNtTools
		* This is to reduce the number of instantiations of the class
		  and open root files polluting the ROOT space when a user
		  uses many instantiations of SusyNtTools (like I do).
		  If this causes problems for users, I can change it back.
	* Updated Susy3LepCutflow code to use new MCWeighter

2014-02-19 Steve
	* Split up the functionality for weighting the MC
		* Temporary change until everything is moved into MCWeighter
		* Added getSumw, getXsecTimesEff, getPileupWeight to SusyNtTools.
		  getEventWeight calls each of these
		* Can now request pileup systematic via sys flag
	* Now allow for NULL Met pointer in Meff methods
		* For calculating Meff/HT without met
	* Added pileup sys enums to MCWeighter: Sys_PILEUP_UP, Sys_PILEUP_DN

2014-02-12 Steve
	* Added call to clearObjects at beginning of SusyNtAna selectObjects
	* Removed LAr veto from Susy3LepCutflow

2014-02-11 Steve
	* Bugfix for muon systematics in n0150
		* Added temporary boolean argument to 
		  SusyNtAna.selectObjects: n0150BugFix
		* This flag propagates down through SusyNtTools 
		  getBaselineObjects, getPreMuons, and finally
		  Muon.setState

2014-02-10 Steve
	* Updated SusyNtTools.eventHasSusyPropagators to return
	  true as soon as a problematic sparticle is found
	* Added susySpartId1 and susySpartId2 to Event class
		* Allows us to recalculate the proc ID on the fly later

2014-02-09 Steve
	* Updated Susy3LepCutflow code
		* Updated cleaning cuts
		* More event selection methods
		* Full MC weighting, including the latest
		  prescriptions for sumw and cross section
		* Skeleton methods for histograms

2014-02-06 Steve
	* Added getBTagSFJets2Lep to SusyNtTools which returns
	  the subset of baseline jets which are tested for the b-veto.
	  These are thus the jets to be passed to the bTagSF method.

2014-02-05 Steve
	* Added MCID and proc ID to Event.print()
	* Changed from hardcoded values to JET_JVF_PT and JET_JVF_ETA in isSignalJet
	* Added template method, dumpObjects, for looping and dumping any 
	  objects with a print() method.

2014-01-29 Steve
	* Added bugfix to getCrossSection for Wh nohadtau signal samples
		* proc ID (susyFinalState) was not saved correctly
		* I will work on redesigning the approach upstream to
		  prevent similar future issues
	* Cleaned up mljj method
	* Added MCID and prod ID to Event.print()
	* Added Met.sumet to the copy constructor and assignment operator (was missing)
	* Added scripts/refreshSUSYToolsData.sh to update SUSYTools/data to trunk

2014-01-22 Steve
	* Fixed SusyNtTools getEventWeight to use 0 when proc ID -1 is found

2014-01-22 Anyes
	* Added functions for mljj 
	* Update 2LSSWh isolation cuts to tighter set (not backward compatible)

2014-01-22 Steve

		  so be careful!

2014-01-17 Steve
	* Changed default value of susyFinalState to 0 to be consistent with SUSYTools
	* Changed order of Hdecay enum in WhTruthExtractor. kUnknown is now 0 to be
	  consistent with susyFinalState and SUSYTools.
	* Added empty MCWeighter class definition which will handle the MC normalization
		* At the moment it only holds the sys enum
	* Added cross section systematic to getEventWeight methods

2014-01-16 Anyes
	* Added SusyDefs: human readable analysis type
	* Added SusyNtAna function to get/set sumw map
	* Added SystNtTools overload function for hasZ and getMT2

2014-01-07 Steve
	* Added clarification comments for the sumw map update of last commit
	* Fixed usage of proc ID when retrieving the sumw

2014-01-04 Steve
	* Updated the sumw map to handle signal samples with multiple processes
		* The map is now keyed by (MCID, proc)
		* New typedefs in SusyDefs: SumwMap, SumwMapKey
		* buildSumwMap method will now find all process cutflow hists
		  in the input files and fill the map accordingly
	* getEventWeight now has new argument for controlling the sumw feature: useProcSumw
		* Setting this to true for all bkg MC and data shouldn't have any effect
		* It should only be set to false for samples that have multiple 
		  processes and you DON'T want to normalize each process separately.
		* NOTE: I changed the order of the arguments!
			* Luckily, the other affected arg is new and 
			  probably nobody is using it yet anyway.

		  it modifies the Makefile to remove the dependencies
	* Removed BTagCalib in favor of the SUSYTools class, 
	  which required updated usage.

2013-12-14 Steve

	* Added functions for selecting taus
		* baseline objects, overlap removal, signal objects

		  because the Mll is not really expected to reproduce the Z peak...
			* I added switches to hasZ, etc.  They will ignore taus by default
		* Lepton has variables unnecessary for taus, so we may want to move things around later.
		* I will keep everything backwards compatible for now and not change the Lepton class

	  the lumi, pileup, xsec combined weight
		* getEventWeight() gets the default weight for A-B14
			* This function can also take a lumi argument, 
			  but the pileup weights will correspond to A-B14

	* Deleted two methods from SusyNtTools that were unnecessary	

2012-06-27 Matt

	  the future.
	* The above has been fixed. You can now inherit from CF. If you don't specify event
	  type it will just save everything under unknown and code shouldn't crash.
